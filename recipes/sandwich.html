<p><strong>A sandwich is a versatile and convenient meal made by layering a variety of fillings between slices of bread or other bread substitutes like buns, rolls, or wraps. The fillings can include a combination of vegetables, meats, cheeses, spreads, and condiments, offering a balance of flavors and textures. Sandwiches can be served cold, like a classic vegetable or turkey sandwich, or hot, like a grilled cheese or panini. Theyâ€™re easy to customize, making them a popular choice for breakfast, lunch, snacks, or even dinner. Perfect for on-the-go meals or a cozy sit-down treat!</strong></p>
